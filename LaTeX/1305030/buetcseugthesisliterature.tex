\section{Introduction}
We need a lot more things to do for reconstructing a scene. Object needs to be recognized. Then need some way to track the movement of the object. And if some of the scenes are missing, then we need to construct that missing scenes. For that, we need to know the velocity, path and nature of the movement of that object to predict the future movement and construct that missing scenes.

In this chapter we will discuss various ground-level researches on \textbf{Image Processing} that will be very useful in our research.
