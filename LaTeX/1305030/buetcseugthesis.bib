abstract="A system has been set up which automatically interprets the binary pixel representation of an image on the basis of a predefined model. The model is that the image contains only a network of polygons with each polygon being labelled by a digit code written within its boundary, and the end point of the interpretive process is the generation of the feature-coded vector representation of each polygon boundary. The main components of the system are a raster-to- vector conversion module, a database module, a symbol extraction and classification module and a polygon recognition module. All but the last module are of more general applicability, and at present the other modules are being used in a system which is being developed for the automatic interpretation of engineering drawings. The main objective of the work was to develop an automated digitizing system capable of handling specially-prepared DoE polygon maps.",

pages="232--245",
abstract="With the emergence of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), map acquisition and recognition have become hotly pursued topics, both by the industry and the academia. The paper presents a novel methodology for the extraction and recognition of symbol features from topographic maps. The method proceeds by separating the map into its constituent layers and then attempting to recognize the features in different layers on the basis of symbol-specific geometrical and morphological attributes. Text strings have also been separated. The output is obtained in the form of an `e-map' that is vectorized and hence is suitable for GIS. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system a simple database along with a query processing facility is constructed integrating the information obtained from the e-map and `some' user inputs. The methodology has been observed to perform quite satisfactorily.",
