			brief desctiption of project
-we want to create a mobile app which will be connected to a database 
- the user of this app will be students and teachers
- this app will work like a social media. 
- There will be Profile for every teacehr which will be provided by education board
- it will serve as a national database for teachers also 
- Students can also open id..... But its not mendatory. Anyone can use this app without login
			Features:
- there will be monthly video training (both mendatory and optional ) for teachers
-there will be subjectwise video lecture for students
-there will be community room for teahers and students where they can discuss abot problems of various subjects
- if teachers complete their training there will be short online test where all teachers around the country will participate
- This trainings will be online. so the teachers dont have to waste their time and govt nednt waste their money for their training
- But why they will participate this trainings ?
because there will be rating system based on their rank in online test, number of trainings done and their activity
-what do we mean by activity ? 
they will upload subjectwise video lecture on this site
the better the video.. the more that teacher will famous
besides they will answer students questions in community room 
that will help their rating too
- where are the students? 
they will use this app for watching these videos
there will be subjectwise(perhaps topicwise lecture) so that the students dont have to run from here to there to find a solutioun on any topic
they can like videos and vote for any particular teacher which will help that teacher to rise on the top of the ranklist
Advantages:
-A competetive environment will be created among teachers and they will try to do better and better for their own sake
- Govt dont have to worry about teachers training
- Students around the country will come in touch of good Teachers so the gap between city and village students will shrink
- This is a fun way of learning
- As the country is getting digitalized day by day we have to start somewhere
- Now a days an android phone is reaching every hand
we have to use this opportunity to connect more people and create a brige among teachers and students which will boost the whole education system
overall its a cheap and smart way of education
